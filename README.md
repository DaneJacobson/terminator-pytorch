Implementation of the Terminator model, in PyTorch

# Questions for Harvie Zhang
- I s-renormalization doesn't seem to be used for the reference implementation's global HyperZZW (specifically your MAGNet_G implementation)
- There doesn't seem to be a 1D FFT implementation for global hyperkernel generation, did I miss it?
